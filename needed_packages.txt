You pretty much will just have to follow the instructions
in the US_COVID19.ipynb file. But if you'd like to have
each of the packages in one place then I am also going to put
them in this file:

import numpy as np
from math import sqrt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import rpy2

import h2o
from h2o.estimators import H2ORandomForestEstimator
from h2o.estimators.glm import H2OGeneralizedLinearEstimator
from h2o.grid.grid_search import H2OGridSearch
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

These are R packages:
%%R
pracma
reshape
Metrics
readr
