You will have to install jupyter and anaconda.
In the anaconda terminal, navigate to where
the ipynb file is.
Then do:            jupyter notebook US_COVID19.ipynb

You then just run each of the sections of code.
If you happen to not have the needed package, you can
install most of them in pip. We found that there were
issues with that and we had to install some of them
with "conda". For example, we did: "conda install rpy2".

Once everything is working, you just step through the
ipynb file and you should be able to see all of our results.
